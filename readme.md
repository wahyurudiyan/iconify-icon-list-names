# Typescript types for Iconify icons

## Forked From
[CaptainObjective/iconify-icon-names](https://github.com/CaptainObjective/iconify-icon-names)


## How to use

First install type with your favorite package manager

```bash
    npm i iconify-icon-names -D
```

```bash
    yarn add iconify-icon-names -D
```

```bash
    pnpm i iconify-icon-names -D
```

Then simply import your favorites icons

```typescript
import type { SimpleIcons } from 'iconify-icon-names';
```

Additionally you can import type for all possible icons (be careful as it might kill your CPU)

```typescript
import type { AllIcons } from 'iconify-icon-names';
```

If you want to list of all possible icons collections you can just import it as type as well

```typescript
import type { Collections } from 'iconify-icon-names';
```
